                    Food and helping people have always been great passions of mine. However, my relationship with food wasn’t always as straightforward as it may seem. I grew up across the pond in Manchester, England and although I wasn’t a stranger to fruits and vegetables in my childhood, my diet was far from wholesome. In fact, I was heavily disconnected from the foods I ate. It wasn’t until my mid 20s, after years of struggling with gastrointestinal issues and what I now understand to be hormonal imbalance, that I decided it was time to take charge of my bodyand begin to rebuild our broken relationship . For the first time in my life I began to converse with my body , listening to what she was telling me through the symptoms she presented, and responding to her as she needed. I turned to nutrition to establish this symbiotic relationship and began to discover that whole foods  combined with self-care paved the way for a complete me . I was fortunate enough to be able to transform my own health through the healing powers of whole foods and lifestyle modifications, an experience which planted the seed for me to share with others. Inspired by my own experiences, I realized that I wanted to be of service to others, helping to optimize health  and create internal harmony by providing nourishment for the mind, body, and soul.

                 Having lived around the globe in England, Israel, Australia and the U.S., it is clear to me that for each and every one of us, nutrition and lifestyle plays a fundamental role in our health outcomes. As in the case of a tree, wherever it is situated, its roots must be nurtured and nourished in order for its stem and branches to flourish, yielding true health. Our foundations mirror those of trees  as we too must tackle the cause of our ailments in order to be achieve true health. I learned that it is only by looking at the person as a whole we can address the root causes of imbalance, facilitate the body’s natural healing mechanisms/processes  (through diet and lifestyle) and in turn create positive changes that have lasting effects.

                After earning my Master’s of Science in Nutrition at the National University of Natural Medicine  in Portland, Oregon, I moved to Los Angeles (LA), California where I decided to open up my own practice (focused on women’s health and wellbeing) to help those seeking nutritional support and looking to improve their health. Recognizing that females are often underrepresented in many areas of our society with healthcare and research as no exception, I decided to pursue my passion of utilizing nutrition and lifestyle as powerful tools for transforming health with a focus on motivating, educating and empowering my clients. Recognizing that each person should be considered on their own merit, distinctions should also be made between the health of women and men; both of which have completely different hormonal profiles and experience health in very different ways.
